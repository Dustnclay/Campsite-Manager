On the front end of this application you will find Form managment utilizing the bootstrap library,
Yup for form validation, The GoogleMaps API for use of viewing and moving marker locations 
and Recharts for the displaying of data in graphs. 

The data sent from the forms is sent to a backend that you will also find in my repos at https://github.com/Dustnclay/Campsite-Manager-BE 

The data is sent to the backend, saved in a SQL database, and receives data from all forms submitted for each campsite. the data is read and compiled in a way 
that makes it compatible with the graphs in recharts.
